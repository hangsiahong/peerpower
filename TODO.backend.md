## üìù Notes

- Keep Khmer language support in mind for all user-facing content
- Design APIs to be mobile-app friendly (efficient, minimal data)
- Plan for Cambodia's internet connectivity challenges
- Consider offline-first design for mobile apps
- Prepare for potential carrier blocking countermeasures
